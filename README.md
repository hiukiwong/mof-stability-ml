## CET IIB Research Project
### Investigating chemical stability of MOFs using Machine Learning
Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are used widely as catalysts in the chemicals industry due to its large surface area to volume ratio. This project was done in collaboration with the Advanced Materials Group at the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Cambridge, and aims to lay a foundation towards accurate prediction of the chemical stability of MOFs using machine learning.
