## CET IIB Research Project
### Investigating chemical stability of MOFs using Machine Learning
Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are used widely as catalysts in the chemicals industry due to its large surface area to volume ratio. This project, in collaboration with the Advanced Materials Group at the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Cambridge,
